# Canada Governance Watch 🇨🇦

**A citizen's toolkit for monitoring government policy, understanding your rights, and taking peaceful civic action.**

## Why This Exists

Your government is rapidly expanding digital surveillance, implementing social credit-style ESG frameworks, and restricting speech through "online harms" legislation. Most Canadians don't realize how quickly fundamental freedoms are being eroded through technical policy changes buried in complex bills.

**This tool helps you:**
- Track legislation like Bill C-2 (buried surveillance powers)
- Monitor Digital ID rollout and mandatory ESG disclosure requirements

## Why This Matters Now

Canada is at a crossroads. The infrastructure for digital authoritarianism is being built piece by piece through:

- **Bill C-2**: Surveillance powers buried in border legislation
- **Digital ID**: Moving toward mandatory digital credentials for government services  
- **ESG Frameworks**: Social credit scoring for businesses and individuals
- **Online Harms**: Potential criminalization of lawful speech

This isn't conspiracy theory - it's policy reality documented in government sources.

**You have tools. Use them.**
